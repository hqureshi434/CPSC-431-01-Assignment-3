### Introduction
Modify the AJAX Chat to convert it into a group chat capable application (2+ chat users).

### Use Cases: 
1. Before user enters the chat room, user can specify a nickname to be used in the chatroom (see wireframe 1)
2. Each can enter a chat message which is then visible to all other users; multiple users using the application simultaneously users are identified by 1) their nicknames shown before their messages and 2) a randomly assigned color as background for the chat bubble (see wireframe 2)
